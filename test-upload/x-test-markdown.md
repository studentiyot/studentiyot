# — THIS IS A TEST — 
# Web Development Bootcamp Tracker

Repository created to record and track my progress in Angela Yu’s *Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp.* Enrollment began on June 3, 2024. This repo contains my notes, projects, and resources as I progress through the boot camp.[^§§] The goal is to build a strong foundation in front-end and back-end technologies.

I’ll attempt to study at least 6 hours a day alongside a Discord Study Group while taking a deliberate lean tech approach to thoroughly comprehend the content and related materials.
