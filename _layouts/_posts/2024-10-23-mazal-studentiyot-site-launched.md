Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be. Well, not really. I'm following Jonathan McGlone's tutorial, [Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](https://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/), which I'm just realizing is over 10 years old! ðŸ˜³

The tutorial is great, though. I hope it will help me work out the kinks while trying to port my GitHub Profile project over to Vercel and Render.
